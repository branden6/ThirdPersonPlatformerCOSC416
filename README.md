# ThirdPersonPlatformer
 
Functions implemented:
- looking around using a third person free look camera
- direction of forward player movement is determined by camera rotation
- jump
- double jump
- boxes (obstacles)
- invisible walls so that player can not leave the playing area
- rotating coin with a coin asset
- UI to increment score when you pick up a coin
- coins destroyed once picked up

I was unable to implement the dash feature unfortunately.
